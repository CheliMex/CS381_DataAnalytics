Consider the HTML string <title>+++BREAKING NEWS+++<title>. We would like to extract the first HTML tag (i.e., “<title>”). To do so we write the regular expression “<.+>”. Explain why this fails and correct the expression.
Consider the string “(5-3)^2=5^2-2*5*3+3^2”. We would like to extract the equation in its entirety from the string. To do so we write the regular expression “[^0-9=+*()]+”. Explain why this fails and correct the expression.
