## 🔬 Topic: Applied Data Science

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Delving into datasets to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with summary statistics and graphical representations.
* **Machine Learning Fundamentals:**
    * **Classification:** Predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., spam/not spam, disease/no disease).
    * **Regression:** Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock values).
    * **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without prior labels (e.g., customer segmentation).
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis and model building.
* **Model Evaluation & Selection:** Understanding metrics and choosing the best models for various tasks.
* **Deployment & MLOps Concepts:** Brief introduction to taking models from development to production.
